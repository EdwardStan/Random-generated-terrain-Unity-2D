# Random generated terrain Unity 2D
 
This unity project alows you to generate 2D Procedual Terrain like the one seen in the game "Hill Climb Racing".

In the inspector you can chose the lenght and the number of points of your terrain.

The script works like this:
1. You set the lenght of the track u need.
2. You set the number of poitns that are responsilbe for the creation of the hills.
3. The script will divide the lenght to the points.
4. The results will represent the distance between the points. More points mean more hills with steeper structure, while less points meaning there will be less hills with smootlier surfaces.
